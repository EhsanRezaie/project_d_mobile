## Session 25 - Discover Polish, Limits, Filters, Logout

### Card Simplification
- **Card shows only**: name + age + gender icon, distance, location (city, province)
- **Removed from card**: interest chips, body type, workplace
- **Kept on card**: Premium badge, Verified badge (bigger circle, 14px icon)

### Profile Detail - Chip Style
- Physical, Lifestyle, Background sections now use **chip/pill layout** (like interests)
- Each value is a rounded pill with emoji prefix (e.g. 📏 175 cm, ⚖️ 70 kg)
- Removed key-value row layout (`_buildInfoRow`)
- About, Languages, Interests, Prompts sections unchanged

### Daily Limits (Likes & Chats)
- **Likes**: 20/day for free users, unlimited for premium
- **Chats**: 10/day for free users, unlimited for premium
- **Badge indicators**: Red circle with remaining count on like and chat buttons
- **Client-side enforcement**: Buttons disabled when limit reached
- **Popup dialog**: AlertDialog shown when tapping blocked button
- **Card stays on limit reached**: Card not removed until explicit pass/like

### Filter Persistence
- Filters saved to SharedPreferences on every change
- Loaded once on first `loadProfiles()` call (not on every load)
- Keys: `discover_gender`, `discover_age_min`, `discover_age_max`, `discover_distance_km`

### Widen Search
- When no results, empty state shows **+50 km** and **+2 years** buttons
- Each tap adds 50km to distance or 2 years to max age
- When max reached (500km / 100 years), sets to null (no limit)
- Backend receives no param → returns all users

### Filter Sliders
- Distance: 1-500km, at max shows "500+ km" (no limit)
- Age: 18-100, at max shows "100+" (no limit)
- When at no-limit, param omitted from API call

### Chat Button Style
- White background + blue icon + blue border (both discover and detail screens)

### Detail Page Navigation
- Like/Pass/Chat actions close the detail page and return to discover
- Next card shown automatically

### Logout
- Settings → Account section → Log Out button (red)
- Confirmation dialog before logout
- Clears tokens, navigates to login screen

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed swipeRight/swipeAndChat: `_removeProfile` now only called after server confirms success
- Fixed limit race condition: `_loadFilters` only called once, not on every empty result
- Fixed detail page navigation: uses MaterialPageRoute (not named routes)

## Session 26 - Search Screen

### Search Grid
- **3-column grid** with compact cards (smaller than Discover cards)
- **Infinite scroll** pagination (loads more when scrolling near bottom)
- **No caching** — all searches use `ApiService.noCache` for real-time results
- **Card shows**: photo, name + age + gender icon, distance, location

### Search Filters
- **Quick filter bar**: Gender, Age range, Distance, Sort, Advanced (opens sheet)
- **Advanced filter sheet** (25+ options):
  - Location: Country → Province → City cascading dropdowns (English)
  - Physical: Height range, Weight range, Body type chips
  - Lifestyle: Relationship, Education, Smoking, Drinking, Political, Children, Living
  - Background: Religion chips, Ethnicity chips
  - Interests: Collapsible by category, multi-select with count badges
  - Languages: Multi-select chips
  - Verification: Has Photos toggle, Verified Only toggle
- **Filter persistence**: All filters saved to SharedPreferences with `search_` prefix
- **Sort options**: Recent (default), Distance, Age, Name

### Search Profile Detail
- Same layout as Discover profile detail (hero image, photo strip, chip sections)
- **2 buttons only**: Like + Chat (no Pass button)
- Uses callbacks instead of Provider (since pushed via Navigator)
- Shows all photos, interests, prompts when backend provides them

### Limits Sync
- Shares same `/rewards/my-limits` endpoint as Discover
- `WidgetsBindingObserver` refreshes limits when app resumes
- Both providers independently call the same backend endpoint

### Files Created
- `lib/services/search_service.dart` — API layer
- `lib/providers/search_provider.dart` — State management
- `lib/widgets/search_grid_card.dart` — Compact card widget
- `lib/screens/search/search_screen.dart` — Main screen
- `lib/screens/search/search_filter_sheet.dart` — Advanced filters
- `lib/screens/search/search_profile_detail.dart` — Detail page

### Localization
- 48 new search keys in `app_en.arb` and `app_fa.arb`
- Filter values in English (location names from API)
- UI labels localized for both languages

## Color Rules (strict)

| Element | Color Source |
|---------|-------------|
| Reject (X) / NOPE stamp / Premium badge / Gender female | `lightError` / `darkError` |
| Chat button / LIKE stamp / Verified badge / Gender male | `lightPrimary` / `darkPrimary` |
| Like (Heart) button / Match dialog heart | `lightPrimary` / `darkPrimary` (via `likeGradient`) |
| Message sent checkmark | `lightSuccess` / `darkSuccess` |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `API_BASE_URL` | Backend API URL | `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api/v1` |
| `WS_BASE_URL` | WebSocket URL for chat | `ws://10.0.2.2:8000/api/v1` |
| `WEB_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth Client ID | Required for Google Sign-In |

## Error Handling

The app provides user-friendly error messages for common scenarios:

| HTTP Status | User Message |
|-------------|--------------|
| 401 | "Incorrect email or password. Please try again." |
| 404 | "User not found. Please check your email." |
| 409 | "Account already exists. Please login." |
| 422 | "Please check your information and try again." |
| 429 | "Too many attempts. Please wait a moment." |
| Network | "Cannot connect to server. Make sure backend is running." |

## Backend Requirements

Make sure the backend server is running:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Verify connection:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/health
```

Expected response: `{"status":"healthy","redis":"connected"}`

## Development

### Run in debug mode

```bash
flutter run
```

### Build APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### Build App Bundle

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection refused

Make sure backend is running and `API_BASE_URL` is correct.

### Google Sign-In not working

Make sure `WEB_CLIENT_ID` is set correctly in `.env` and `google-services.json` is configured.

### Packages not downloading

If you have network issues, try:

```bash
flutter pub get --offline
```

### Emulator can't connect to localhost

Use `10.0.2.2` instead of `localhost` in `.env` file.

### Location not working

Make sure location permissions are enabled and GPS is on.
